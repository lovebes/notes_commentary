지금 내가 해야하는 건.. 
commit the changes I made to use BehaviorSubject
okay I've changed the components to directly use the VisitService.

Initially this works because BehaviorSubject will start with initial data structure.
However it still needs to be tested if loading stored data will work,

but in order to do that the data model has to be updated to reflect the backend schemas.

oh yeah. I gotta bind the test types first..
아이고 또 gizmodo watched. I should've just written here.

This isn't that bad. I can just steam off here. and then try to focus back to code because I get bored writing. I really have a lack of skill in grammar.

okay. I've added the revised visit model, but now it won't retrieve what has been stored. Weird..

... shit profile questionnaires seems to repopulate every time there is a static call. Naive .push() done. This is the point where statics population should be the StaticService.

에고.

okay.. insurance view should be fixed. I can't get it to display insurance name. Why is it hidden? weird.
Because now we have odd number of elements, the view structure of index, index+1 doesn't work.
maybe i can do it via flex, attaching elements horizontally.
